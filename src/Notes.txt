NEXT STEPS:

Use Debug setting to control log4net logging level (config is the default, but setting overrides it) ???

AddToDictionary - display list of viable options (individual words + whole sentence(s)) from OutputService.Text
	+ Log, notify and play sound when adding new entry

	Log.Debug(string.Format(
                "Info event received from service. Raising NotificationRequest and playing InfoSoundFile (from settings). Title:'{0}', Message:'{1}'", 
                titleAndMessage.Item1, titleAndMessage.Item2));

            NotificationRequest.Raise(new Notification
            {
                Title = titleAndMessage.Item1,
                Content = titleAndMessage.Item2
            });

            audioService.PlaySound(Settings.Default.InfoSoundFile);

Make sure usage counts are incremented & decremented correctly (when swapping, or backspace removing last entry)
Add diactritic keyboard(s). I guess this would be alphabet specific (e.g. latin alphabet)
More keyboard
	+ Buttons for Publish & Diacritic keyboards
	+ Settings button
	+ Rest button
Add settings
	+ normal settings (hotkey window)
	+ accessible settings - keyboard style
Dictionary management window
	+ Add
	+ Remove
Add high contrast theme

Pass timestamped points through to logic which matches multi-key selection keyvalues to words - this allows that logic to examine exactly how the selection was made
Profile and optimise

TO DO?
Character codes – ALT on/lock, then numbers, then ALT off
Auto complete words
