NEXT STEPS:

Add logging to mainVM and anywhere else not properly covered (extension classes, behaviours, controls)
Hook up Error events on all service classes and display errors (main view model needs reference to every service to log)
	+ Make sure when publishing errors they are logged
	+ Error tones
Change AddPhraseToDictionary (and icon name) to AddToDictionary and display list of viable options (individual words + whole sentence(s))
Make sure usage counts are incremented & decremented correctly (when swapping, or backspace removing last entry)
Add diactritic keyboard(s). I guess this would be alphabet specific (e.g. latin alphabet)
