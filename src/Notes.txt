NEXT STEPS:

!Shift is not being reset after capture
Test that Backspace keys are disabled when ctrl/alt are on

Add 3 modifier keys to Publish keyboard
Add caret to scratchpad - http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/633935/Customizing-the-Caret-of-a-WPF-TextBox
Swap in suggestions
	+ Clear suggestions when any input, except swapping suggestions is output
	+ Apply shift state to suggestions when they are initially set - therefore swapping them in matches casing of 1st suggestion used as capture
Auto capitalise
Speak
Error tones
Publish keys
	+ Ctor & Publish state change: Manually reset keyboard to default state (caps lock etc)
Change AddPhraseToDictionary (and icon name) to AddToDictionary and display list of viable options (individual words + whole sentence(s))
