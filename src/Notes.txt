NEXT STEPS:

Make sure usage counts are incremented & decremented correctly (when swapping, or backspace removing last entry)
Add diactritic keyboard(s). I guess this would be alphabet specific (e.g. latin alphabet)
More keyboard
	+ Buttons for Publish & Diacritic keyboards
	+ Settings button
	+ Rest button
Add settings
	+ normal settings (hotkey window)
	+ accessible settings - keyboard style
Dictionary management window
	+ Add
	+ Remove
Add high contrast theme

Pass timestamped points through to logic which matches multi-key selection keyvalues to words - this allows that logic to examine exactly how the selection was made
