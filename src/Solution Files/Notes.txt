NEXT STEPS:

!Start up with TheEyeTribe as point source, but not running - displays error correctly, but process doesn't end cleanly and there is a big pause before anything is displayed.
	Delay = trying to Activate?
	Shutdown prevented = need to Deactivate on shutdown? GazeManager.Instance.Deactivate(); Add everything that needs cleaning up to an Rx CompositeDisposable, including TheEyeTribePointService, which could be made disposable to Deactive connection.

Pause point source when doing work, e.g.matching capture to words. Maybe just disable all in KeyEnabledStates? This is to prevent selection when you don't mean to select anything
	?Potentially also add a small pause after selection when using fixation triggers - this is to prevent the next selection starting immediately on the same key we just selected?

Change equality comparisons for floating point types (float, double) back to near-equality (subtract them, Abs the result and check if < tolerance). Some arithmatic may work in Debug where the JIT compiler cannot use the full float range, but fail in Release.

Hot keys/shortcut keys:
	1. Complexity - Basic (speaking only, maybe no AddToDictionary) -> Advanced
		- Hotkey to toggle and store in Settings - e.g. Ctrl+F
		- When switching to Basic mode removes everything irrelevent (Publishing, MultiKeyCapturing, AddToDictionary, PublishOnly, Menu, Symbols)
			- Publishing off (which should reset down keys)
			- Multi-key selection off
			? Leave Sleep and Recalibrate in?

	2. What happens if the user changes something like the points source, but it is not working - no way to change back
		(Factory reset - just delete user settings folder)
		- Hot keys to toggle settings, e.g. position, point source, trigger source, etc.
			!ETTA does not support changing input sources at runtime - restart required - TELL USERS IN POPUP!

	3. Debug setting

	4. Recalibrate

!Release down keys logic seems to release keys which aren't down, e.g. F4 on shutdown!

Add settings
	+ accessible settings - keyboard style
		* include ability to move and resize keyboard
	? normal settings (hotkey window)

Recalibrate functionality

Dictionary management window
	+ Add
	+ Remove
	
Profile and optimise, especially keyboard transitions

Refactor any remaining large classes, e.g. MainViewModel

Add support for USB (hardware) buttons (to act as triggers)?

TO DO?
Store usage statistics in a case sensitive way? Would need to keep track of originally cased entries (incl. suggestions). Does this have any benefit? Think about whole advantage of storing usage statistics. 
Character codes – ALT on/lock, then numbers, then ALT off
Auto complete words
	+ auto correct words
Predict next word
Add high contrast theme
