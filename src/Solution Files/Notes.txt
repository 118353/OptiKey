NEXT STEPS:

Move Activation out of TET point source ctor - do it when first event listener attaches.
	TEST TET POINT SOURCE, INCLUDING THROWING ERRORS

Pass language into dictionary service methods LoadDictionary + any other methods that directly reference Settings.Default.Language

Create WindowMoveAndResizeService
	MoveLeft(double pixels)
	MoveLeftToBoundary()
	MoveRight(double pixels)
	MoveRightToBoundary()
	MoveUp(double pixels)
	MoveUpToBoundary()
	MoveDown(double pixels)
	MoveDownToBoundary()
	ReSizeLeft(double pixels)
	ResizeLeftToBoundary()
	ReSizeRight(double pixels)
	ResizeRightToBoundary()
	ReSizeUp(double pixels)
	ResizeUpToBoundary()
	ReSizeDown(double pixels)
	ResizeDownToBoundary()

		Debug mode (setting) (or command line arg?)

	Application.Restart(); after changing some of the settings? Prompt user to restart (after saving) if certain settings have been changed.

X VisualMode setting - Standard / SpeechOnly
	- When switching mode make sure KeyDownStates (which should automatically change settings also?) are reset:
		X - Publishing off (which should release down keys automatically?)
		X - Multi-key selection off
		X - Set Keyboard back to Alpha
		X - Leave Sleep and Recalibrate in
	TEST SWITCHING MODES

Think about how to pause/prevent the point source during multi-key selection processing.
	Disabling all points prevents the Multi-key selection trigger storyboard from playing as the disabled datatrigger is taking precedence.
		CAN I MAKE THE ANIMATION TAKE CORRECT PRECEDENCE?
Pause point source when switching keyboards - on unload/load of content of Keyboard host, i.e. when KeyboardHost.Content changes

Profile and optimise, especially keyboard transitions

Refactor any remaining large classes, e.g. MainViewModel

!Release down keys logic seems to release keys which aren't down, e.g. F4 on shutdown!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO DO?
Add transparency - accessible from keyboard?
Prevent minimising/maximising - must be windowed at all times
Add support for USB (hardware) buttons (to act as triggers)?
Store usage statistics in a case sensitive way? Would need to keep track of originally cased entries (incl. suggestions). Does this have any benefit? Think about whole advantage of storing usage statistics. 
Character codes – ALT on/lock, then numbers, then ALT off
Auto complete words
	+ auto correct words
Predict next word
Add high contrast theme

No position input possible - automatically cycle through groups of keys, then keys in group: 
	Keyboards could define ordered set of KeyValues; the key "groups"
	New SelectionMode = KeyGroups - this then changes to PositionSource to a source which automatically loops through the current keyboard's groups.
	Position source can output more than one current point: CurrentKey would become a set (allowing the highlighting of a group of keys)
	Selection (of a set of KeyValues) when SelectionMode = KeyGroups does not produce a SelectionResult, but instead disables all keys not in the group (not explicitly, but instead based on a property, e.g. CurrentKeyGroup). SelectionMode then changes to Key.
	In Key mode the position source could iterate through all enabled keys in the key map (which should be the selected group of keys).
		Selection => normal key selection and reset mode back to KeyGroups.
		? If no selection in X iterations through the keys then output a special selection, e.g. a null selection (the trigger can watch the position source, like the fixation triggers.
	Each key group should contain a 'back' key to return from group selection?
	
Add support for T9 style selection; either individual keys, or multi key select?
