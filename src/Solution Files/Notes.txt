NEXT STEPS:

Fix publish bugs (timing between key presses?)
	!Backspace not publishing as expected - back spacing whole word at a time!
	!Backspace not publishing with modifier (e.g. shift)!
	!Win key should be tri-state - it is a modifier so add to all modifier logic!
	!Win key not being published on its own!
	!Arrow keys not publishing as expected - jumping left/right whole line, as if Ctrl is on!
	!PgUp/PgDown not publishing as expected!

Move sleep into keyboards (replace Sleep in More keyboard with Recalibrate). Make Space 2 keys wide and add Sleep in bottom right?

Instantiate services AFTER View has loaded - this gives us the chance to display a notification message if services error during initialisation (e.g. InputService can publish an Error event if the TET service is not running, but this will not be displayed. It also prevents clean shutdown.)

Add settings
	+ normal settings (hotkey window)
	+ accessible settings - keyboard style
		* include ability to move and resize keyboard

Recalibrate
	
Dictionary management window
	+ Add
	+ Remove
	
Add high contrast theme

Profile and optimise, especially keyboard transitions
Refactor any remaining large classes, e.g. MainViewModel

TO DO?
Store usage statistics in a case sensitive way? Would need to keep track of originally cased entries (incl. suggestions). Does this have any benefit? Think about whole advantage of storing usage statistics. 
Character codes – ALT on/lock, then numbers, then ALT off
Auto complete words
	+ auto correct words
Predict next word

Known limitation; cannot hold down a modifier, e.g. holding down Alt and toggling with Tab, then releasing Alt when selection is as we want it. This would be solved by simulating key downs (for modifiers) and then key ups as they are released, but this requires synchronising all key states on startup and shutdown (could manage this from the KeyDownStates class). Need to test this again as previously this didn’t work.
