        <h2><a id="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting started - type your first word</h2>
        <p>Run OptiKey and it will be displayed with a dark theme, position itself somewhere in the top left corner of your screen, and hover above all other applications. By default it uses your mouse cursor position for input and and selecting a key is performed by hovering over a key for about 1.5 seconds. Try it out - move your mouse cursor over OptiKey and notice how the current key under your cursor is highlighted with a red outline. Keep the mouse cursor over a single key and you'll see an indication of your selection progress on the current key. This is a method of selection called "fixation" or "dwell" and requires you to keep your attention (the cursor) on each key for an amount of time in order to select the key. Complete a selection over a letter and it will be pressed and appear in the "scratchpad" at the top. You will also notice that some auto complete suggestions will appear above the scratchpad. Keep selecting letters to type a whole word, or select one of the auto complete suggestions to complete your word. If you make a mistake you can use the backspace key <img src="images/Key_BackOne_Up.png" /> to delete your last selection or <img src="images/Key_BackMany_Up.png" /> to delete the last whole word. That's all there is to start selecting keys and typing words...</p>
        <p><div class="image-container"><img src="images/Keyboard_Alpha_Typing_Welcome_Sentence.png" /></div></p>
        

        <h2><a id="numbers-symbols-diacritics-currencies" class="anchor" href="#numbers-symbols-diacritics-currencies" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Going beyond letters - numbers, symbols and diacritics</h2>
        <p>At some point you'll probably want to type a number, symbol, or diactrical letter (e.g. an accented e). For numbers and symbols you want the <img src="images/Key_Symbols_Up.png" /> key, which will take you to a different keyboard. There are too many symbols to fit on one screen, but you can toggle between the symbol keyboard screens by selecing the <img src="images/Key_Symbol_1of3_Up.png" />, <img src="images/Key_Symbol_2of3_Up.png" />, and <img src="images/Key_Symbol_3of3_Up.png" /> keys. At any time you can select the <img src="images/Key_Alpha_Up.png" /> key to go back to the main (A-Z letters) keyboard.</p>

        <p>If you want diacritical letters or currency symbols then select the <img src="images/Key_Menu_Up.png" /> key and then the diacritic key (#1 in the menu screenshot below) or currency key (#2 in the menu screenshot below). Again, there are more options than it is possible to fit on one screen, so use the "1 of X", "2 of X" keys to move between the screens. As before, the <img src="images/Key_Alpha_Up.png" /> key on each of those keyboards takes you back to the letters keyboard.

        <div class="image-container"><img src="images/Keyboard_Menu_Numbered.png" /></div>


        <h2><a id="using-eye-trackers" class="anchor" href="#using-eye-trackers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Control OptiKey with your eyes:</h2>
        <p>As an alternative to selecting keys with your mouse cursor, OptiKey also supports selection using only your eyes (eye trackers currently supported: GazeTracker and TheEyeTribe). Connect your tracker and start the tracker's application(s) (e.g. for TheEyeTribe you would start the client and server applications). Complete any initial setup to get the tracker up and running; usually this involves getting yourself/your tracker/your screen in the correct position and competing a calibration. Once it's tracking your eyes reliably start OptiKey.
        Once OptiKey has started, open the Management Console (with OptiKey focussed press ALT + M)  and select the "Pointing & Selecting" tab, then change the "Source" (under "Pointing") to your tracking device. Leave the "Key selection source" and "Point selection source" set to "Fixation" for now). Click "OK" to save your changes. OptiKey may need to restart, but your changes will be saved. When OptiKey starts up again it will be listening to your eye tracker so try looking around rather than using the mouse cursor to make key selections.</p>


        <h2><a id="changing-selection-sources" class="anchor" href="#changing-selection-sources" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Changing how selections are made (fixations/key presses/mouse button clicks):</h2>
        <p>There are a few ways to make selections, such as selecting a key. We've already seen the fixation method, where you dwell over a key for a period of time until the selection is made, but you can also use a keyboard key or mouse button to indicate that you want to make a selection. To change the selection method open the Management Console (with OptiKey focussed press ALT + M) and select the "Pointing & Selecting" tab. Under "Selection" you'll see "Key selection source" and "Point selection source"; the former is the setting to change the way keys are selected, whilst the latter is the setting to change the way points are selected when simulating mouse control. When you change either method you will be shown other associated settings, for example if you select that you would like the "Key selection source" to be "Keyboard Key" then there will be a setting to change which key is used (and likewise for "Mouse button").</p>

        <p>Try it out - change the "Key selection source" to "Keyboard key". By default it will expect the "Ins"/"Insert" key, so click "OK" to save your changes (and restart OptiKey), direct your attention to a key, and press the "Ins" key once to select that key.</p>

         
        <h2><a id="speech" class="anchor" href="#speech" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Making OptiKey speak:</h2>
        <p>Type whatever you want spoken into the scratchpad and then select the <img src="images/Key_Speak_Up.png" /> key. The voice, rate of speech and volume are all changeable from the Management Console (with OptiKey focussed press ALT + M). Which voices you can choose depends on which voices are installed in your copy of Windows (please google for instructions on how to add new voices as the method varies for each version of Windows).</p>


        <h2><a id="simulate-keyboard" class="anchor" href="#simulate-keyboard" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Simulate physical keyboard presses to type into other applications:</h2>
        <p>Typing words into the scratchpad is great if you only want OptiKey to speak, but you can also use OptiKey to simulate keystrokes on a physical keyboard and type into other applications. To get started clear the scratchpad using the <img src="images/Key_Clear_Up.png" /> key. Then select the <img src="images/Key_SimulateKeyStrokes_Up.png" /> key turn keystroke simulation on (the key will stay locked down until you decide you want to release it by selecting it again). Now select another application where you would like to begin typing, e.g. type a letter into Microsoft Word, or an email into Gmail. For now use your physical mouse to select where you would like to start typing (I will show you how to control the mouse with OptiKey shortly). Start typing words - they will appear in both the scratchpad and your selected application and <img src="images/Key_BackOne_Up.png" /> and <img src="images/Key_BackMany_Up.png" /> can be used to correct any mistakes.</p>

        <div class="image-container"><img src="images/Typing_Into_Word.png" /></div>

        <p>You may have also noticed that some new keys are available now that the <img src="images/Key_SimulateKeyStrokes_Locked_Down.png" /> key is pressed, for example the <img src="images/Key_Shift_Up.png" />, <img src="images/Key_Ctrl_Up.png" />, <img src="images/Key_Win_Up.png" />, and <img src="images/Key_Alt_Up.png" /> keys. These work in exactly the same way as they do on a physical keyboard, and can be combined with other keys by holding them down - try selecting one of them and you'll notice that it cycles through 3 states; UP, DOWN, and LOCKED DOWN (e.g. <img src="images/Key_Shift_Up.png" />, <img src="images/Key_Shift_Down.png" />, <img src="images/Key_Shift_Locked_Down.png" />), before returning to UP. This makes it easy to press or lock down a number of keys together, for example select CTRL to press it down, and then press the "P" key to send the "Print" command to the active application. Check if any of these "modifier" keys are pressed if you experience unexpected behaviour while typing into another application, as it is easy to forget that the <img src="images/Key_Shift_Up.png" />, <img src="images/Key_Ctrl_Up.png" />, <img src="images/Key_Win_Up.png" />, or <img src="images/Key_Alt_Up.png" /> key(s) is(are) locked down and affecting what you are trying to type.</p>

        <p>One last thing... with <img src="images/Key_SimulateKeyStrokes_Up.png" /> enabled there is a whole new keyboard available to you; 'Physical' (#3 in the menu keyboard screenshot below), which you'll find in the menu by selecting the <img src="images/Key_Menu_Up.png" /> key. This keyboard contains all the keyboard keys we've not covered yet, such as ESCAPE, INSERT, ARROW KEYS, FUNCTION KEYS, etc.</p>

        <div class="image-container"><img src="images/Keyboard_Menu_Numbered.png" /></div>


        <h2><a id="simulate-mouse" class="anchor" href="#simulate-mouse" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Simulate mouse control to click, drag and scroll:</h2>
        <p>OptiKey is able to simulate mouse input, meaning you can click, drag and scroll as if using a physical mouse. To open the mouse keyboard select the <img src="images/Key_Menu_Up.png" /> key and then the 'Mouse' key (#4 in the menu keyboard screenshot below).</p>

        <div class="image-container"><img src="images/Keyboard_Menu_Numbered.png" /></div>

        <p>The basic mouse actions (left, middle and right click, or scrolling - #1 to #4, and #7 to #14 in the mouse keyboard screenshot below) are performed by selecting the desired key and then directing your attention to the point where you wish to perform the click or scroll (a large cursor will be displayed to show where OptiKey will click/scroll, together with a progress indicator). If you turn on the <img src="images/Key_Magnifier_Locked_Down.png" /> option then selecting a point becomes a two step process;</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Direct your attention to roughly where you wish to click/scroll, at which point a magnified image of that area will be displayed.</li>
          <li>Direct your attention to exactly where you wish to click/scroll in the magnified image to perform the action at that point (or select outside the magnified area to cancel the action).</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Drag (#5 in the mouse keyboard screenshot below) is slightly different as two selections have to be made after you select the drag key;

        <ol>
          <li>Select point one (this will be a two step process if you have <img src="images/Key_Magnifier_Locked_Down.png" /> turned on) - this will be where the mouse button is pressed and held down.</li>
          <li>Select point two (again, a two step process if using the magnify feature) - this will be the point to which the mouse cursor is dragged and released.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The 'Repeat Last' key (#6 in the mouse keyboard screenshot below) allows you to repeat the last mouse action taken, which can be useful if you want to scroll down a long web page one scroll at a time, for example.</p>

        <p>You'll also notice the modifier keys (#16 to #19 on the mouse keyboard screenshot below) - if you have <img src="images/Key_SimulateKeyStrokes_Locked_Down.png" /> locked down then this section shows you which of the modifier keys are held down and allows you to release them, as holding down any of the <img src="images/Key_Shift_Up.png" />, <img src="images/Key_Ctrl_Up.png" />, <img src="images/Key_Win_Up.png" />, or <img src="images/Key_Alt_Up.png" /> keys can change what happens when you attempt to take a mouse action, such as clicking.</p>

        <div class="image-container"><img src="images/Keyboard_Mouse_Numbered.png" /></div>

        <p>Mouse actions not behaving as expected? <h1>*LINK TO TROUBLESHOOTING*</h1></p>

<!--    Customising the level of magnification when performing mouse actions
        If you are performing mouse actions with the ***MAGNIFY LOCKED*** option turned on, then you might want to customise how the magnified image appears;
        1.With OptiKey focussed press ALT + M to open the Management Console.
        2.Select the 'Visuals' tab and find the "Look" section. You'll see 4 settings which control how the magnification appears:
          i)'Magnify source area - percentage of screen' - The area around the mouse cursor to magnify as a percentage of the screen.
          ii)'Magnifier fills percentage of screen' - How much of the screen to fill with the magnified image. 
          The ratio between these two settings determines the zoom level. For example if 'Magnifier fills percentage of screen' is 80% and 'Magnify source are - percentage of screen' is 10% you'll see the captured area magnified by 8 times.



        Multikey Selection - Speed up your typing by selecting a whole word (or even whole phrase - see "Typing whole phrase" below) in one go:
        Instead of typing each letter of a word individually, it is possible to capture a whole word (or phrase) in one go. To activate multikey selection select the ***MULTIKEY SELECTION*** key to lock it down ***MULTIKEY SELECTION LOCKED ON***. The process of capturing a word using fixation selection would be;
        1.Select the first letter of the word, e.g. the "h" if you want to type "hello". You have begun capturing the word (or phrase).
        2.Direct your attention to each letter in the word. You don't have to select each one, just briefly register your interest in each letter; "e", "l", then "o". Don't worry about double letters like the "ll" in "hello" - OptiKey will figure that out for you.
        3.When you get to the last letter select it to signal that you are finished capturing the word (or phrase). OptiKey will match what you captured with its dictionary of words and phrases and type the best match to the "scratchpad". Alternative suggestions will be displayed at the top, which you can select if OptiKey matched your capture to the wrong word.
        *** SCREENSHOTS ANNOTATED TO SHOW HOW HELLO IS CAPTURED ***

        Multikey selection learns which words you use frequently and will improve its suggestions over time.

        Bad or failed multikey selection matches? *** LINK TO TROUBLESHOOTING ***


        Typing whole phrases:
        Whole phrases are types in the same way as whole words, but instead of typing each letter of each word, instead you only type the first letter of each word. For example if you had the phrase "how are you" in the dictionary, then could type this in one go with the following steps;
        1.Select the first letter of the first word, i.e. the "h" from "how". This begins the capture.
        2.Direct your attention to the first letter of each word, so "a", then "y" in our example.
        3.Stay on the last letter ("y") to select it and signal that you are finished capturing. The set of matching words and phrases will be calculated and the best choice output to the scratchpad (the rest of the suggestions will appear at the top, above the scratchpad).
        Don't forget that for a multikey selection to match to your desired word or phrase then it must be in the dictionary - see 'Add/remove dictionary words, and change the dictionary language' for more.


        Auto space & auto capitalisation:
        To help speed things along OptiKey will work out if your next word is the start of a new sentence and press the ***SHIFT*** key for you to capitalise the first letter. This works when typing letter by letter, as well as typing whole words using multikey selection.
        OptiKey further increases your rate of typing by automatically inserting spaces between words and sentences. This works best when using multikey selection to enter whole words and phrases.
        Both of these features can be toggled on or off from the Management Console (with OptiKey focussed press ALT + M). They are on by default.


        Add/remove dictionary words, and change the dictionary language:
        The default dictionary contains many common words, but you will probably want to customise it by adding and removing entries.
        You can view and customise the whole dictionary from the Management Console (with OptiKey focussed press ALT + M).
        You can add words and phrases to the dictionary from the scratchpad by pressing the ***ADD ENTRY TO DICTIONARY*** key. OptiKey will examine the words and sentences that you have already typed into the scratchpad and ask you which you would like to add to the dictionary, so the standard wordflows would be;
        * To add a word just type it on its own, or as part of a sentence, and then select the ***ADD ENTRY TO DICTIONARY*** key and choose to add that word when prompted.
        * To add a phrase it is probably best to clear the scratchpad using the ***NEW*** key, and then type the phrase exactly as you would like it to be avaialble in the dictionary (pay attention to how the words are cased when you add the phrase to the dictionary - you don't need to capitalise the first letter unless it is a proper noun as OptiKey will auto capitalise the first letter if it is the start of a new sentence).


        Change size/position/opacity:
        OptiKey can be resized, moved, or made more/less transparent from the ***SIZE*** and ***POSITION*** keyboards available from the ***MENU*** menu.
        ***SCREENSHOT OF SIZE & POSITION KEYS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE MENU KEYBOARD***
        ***ANNOTATED SCREENSHOT OF SIZE KEYBOARD***
        ***ANNOTATED SCREENSHOT OF POSITION KEYBOARD***


        Settings and the Management Console:
        We've already touched on a few settings which you might want to change, but there are lots of ways to customie OptiKey, including how long it takes to make a selection when using a dwell trigger, the theme OptiKey uses, and all sorts of audio settings (voices, selection sounds, etc).
        * With OptiKey focussed (applications are "focussed" when you are using them and will appear highlighted on the Windows taskbar - click on OptiKey to focus it if another application as focus), with OptiKey focussed press ALT + M to open the Management Console. You will need to use a standard keyboard and mouse to make changes in the Management Console, and OptiKey may need to restart to apply your changes. Below is an overview of the available settings:
        *** LIST OF SETTINGS AND A DESCRIPTION OF EACH - Name, Desc ***


        Change the theme: 
        * Open the Management Console (with OptiKey focussed press ALT + M), select the 'Visuals' tab at the top, change the 'Theme' and then click the OK button at the bottom.


        Speech only mode:
        If you only want to use the speech feature of OptiKey then you can simplify OptiKey to only the keys you need;
        * Open the Management Console (with OptiKey focussed press ALT + M), select the 'Visuals' tab at the top, change the 'Keyboard Set' to 'Speech Only' and then click the OK button at the bottom.


        Language support
        OptiKey has been designed to support multiple languages, but at the moment only supports British, Canadian and American English. If you would like to see OptiKey in your language please email me at optikeyfeedback@gmail.com and we can make it happen.


        Take a break - sleeping / pausing OptiKey
        You might want to pause OptiKey while you take a short rest or do something else, especially if you are using an eye tracker and fixation (dwell) trigger which constantly reacts to your gaze. To temporarily pause OptiKey select the ***SLEEP*** key anywhere it appears (it appears on most keyboards). OptiKey will be temporarily disabled while you rest. To wake it again just select the ***SLEEP*** key once more.


        Where is the rest of this guide?

        I'm planning to enrich this website organically as I discover how people are using OptiKey and what issues they are facing. If you want to know something that isn't covered here then please email me at optikeyfeedback@gmail.com - I'll help you and add the information here if I think other people might find it useful.
