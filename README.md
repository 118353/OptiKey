This application is a customisable, extendable, free and open-source on-screen keyboard designed to allow interaction with people who may not be able to (or want to) use standard hardware, and/or have the ability to communicate.

Licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (Version 3, 29 June 2007). A copy of this license accompanies each install, as well as the source code (in the "Solution Items" folder).

I am currently preparing to begin publicly testing V1. More features and more information will be made available in due course.
