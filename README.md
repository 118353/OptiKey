# OptiKey

OptiKey is a free, open source, assistive on-screen keyboard which runs on Windows. It was designed to be used with an eye-tracking device to bring keyboard control, mouse control and speech to people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) / Motor Neuron Disease (MND).

It includes support for assistive buttons, as well as more conventional devices like the mouse and keyboard, opening up to everyone the ability to fully interact with a computer and communicate freely.

# Getting Started

[**The OptiKey WIKI**](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/) contains full information on getting started, system requirements, a user guide, a troubleshooting page, and more. Here are some quick links if you're in a hurry:

* If you want to install and use OptiKey on Windows then download the installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/releases/latest).
* If you want to build from source then download the [master ZIP file](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/archive/master.zip).
* If you wish to contribute then please email me at <optikeyfeedback@gmail.com>. Your next step will be to [fork the repo](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/fork) and start enhancing the code.

# Supported Platforms

OptiKey target the .Net 4.5 Framework, which is available from Windows Vista SP2 onwards. I believe this is the current list, but it should run anywhere the .Net 4.5 Framework can be installed:

* Windows Vista, Service Pack 2
* Windows 7
* Windows 8
* Windows 8.1
* Windows 8.1, Update 1
* Windows Server 2008, Service Pack 2
* Windows Server 2008 R2, Service Pack 1
* Windows Home Server 2011
* Windows Server 2012
* Windows Server 2012 R2
* and anything later, so Windows 10...
