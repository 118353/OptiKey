# OptiKey

OptiKey is an assistive on-screen keyboard which runs on Windows and can be controlled using eye-tracking devices like TheEyeTribe and ITU GazeTracker. It can be used to replace a physical keyboard, control the mouse, and generate speech. The software includes a huge set of characters and symbols, support for word prediction and “swiping”, and a lot of customisable features such as visual themes, keyboard size, position, etc. It works out of the box once you have your eye-tracking device installed and allows selections to be made using physical buttons, dwell selection, etc. If you do not have an eye tracking device you can use OptiKey with a mouse.

OptiKey can be downloaded for free and is fully open-source if you would like to change or improve anything.


# Getting Started

[**The OptiKey WIKI**](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/wiki/) contains full information on getting started, system requirements, a user guide, a troubleshooting page, and more. Here are some quick links if you're in a hurry:

* If you want to install and use OptiKey on Windows then download the installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/releases/latest).
* If you want to build from source then download the [master ZIP file](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/archive/master.zip).
* If you wish to contribute then please email me at <optikeyfeedback@gmail.com>. Your next step will be to [fork the repo](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/fork) and start enhancing the code.

# Supported Platforms

OptiKey target the .Net 4.5 Framework, which is available from Windows Vista SP2 onwards. I believe this is the current list, but it should run anywhere the .Net 4.5 Framework can be installed:

* Windows Vista, Service Pack 2
* Windows 7
* Windows 8
* Windows 8.1
* Windows 8.1, Update 1
* Windows Server 2008, Service Pack 2
* Windows Server 2008 R2, Service Pack 1

* and anything later, so Windows 10...
