Eye Tracking Transcription Assistant

This application is a customisable, extendable, free and open-source on-screen keyboard designed to allow interaction with people who may not be able to (or want to) use standard hardware, and/or have the ability to communicate.

I am currently preparing to begin publicly testing V1. More features and more information will be made available in due course.

If you want to help or try the software please get in touch; JuliusSweetland@gmail.com
