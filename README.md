# OptiKey

Free, Open Source, Assistive On-Screen Keyboard

OptiKey is a free, assistive on-screen keyboard for Windows. It can be controlled by any number of input devices, including eye-tracking devices and assistive buttons, as well as more conventional devices like the mouse and keyboard. OptiKey can simulate a physical keyboard and mouse, as well as generate speech, giving everyone the ability to fully interact with a computer and communicate freely.

# Getting Started

* If you want to install and use OptiKey on Windows then download the [OptiKey latest installer](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/releases/latest).
* If you want to build from source then download the [master ZIP file](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/archive/master.zip).
* If you wish to contribute then please email me at <optikeyfeedback@gmail.com>. Your next step will be to [fork the repo](https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/fork) and start enhancing the code.
