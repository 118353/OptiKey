Free, Open Source, Assistive On-Screen Keyboard

OptiKey is a free, assistive on-screen keyboard for Windows. It can be controlled by any combination of eye movement (using eye-tracking devices), mouse movement, keyboard presses, and mouse clicks giving everyone the ability to fully interact with a computer and communicate freely.

Please check out the OptiKey landing page for information on how to get it, how to use it, how to contact me, and how to get involved: http://www.optikey.org
