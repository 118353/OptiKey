# OptiKey

Interact with your computer and speak using this assistive on-screen keyboard.

OptiKey can be controlled by any combination of eye movement (using eye-tracking devices¹), mouse movement, keyboard presses, and mouse clicks giving everyone the ability to fully interact with a computer and communicate freely.

Licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (Version 3, 29 June 2007). A copy of this license accompanies each install, as well as the source code (in the "Solution Items" folder).

OptiKey is nearly ready for public testing and updates will appear here.

I can be contacted here if you have any questions, find a bug, have a suggestion, or would like to get involved: optikeyfeedback@gmail.com

Thanks for your interest.

Julius

¹ The following eye trackers are currently supported, but OptiKey has been designed so adding support for new input sources is straightforward. This is also an open source project, so if your tracker is not supported why not get involved? Drop me an email and I'll give you more info on how to get started.
