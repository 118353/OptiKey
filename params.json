{"name":"OptiKey","tagline":"Free, Open Source, Assistive On-Screen Keyboard","body":"### What is it?\r\nOptiKey is a free assistive on-screen keyboard. It can be controlled by any combination of eye movement (using eye-tracking devices), mouse movement, keyboard presses, and mouse clicks giving everyone the ability to fully interact with a computer and communicate freely. It will run on computers, laptops and tablets running **Windows**.\r\n\r\n### Which eye trackers are supported?\r\nCurrently the following trackers are supported:\r\n* TheEyeTribe\r\n* GazeTracker\r\nAdding new input devices is straightforward. If you have an unsupported tracker get in touch and we can add support for it.\r\n\r\n### How do I get it?\r\nThe latest installer is always available here: https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey/releases/latest\r\n\r\n### How do I use it?\r\nI'll flesh this section out very soon! In the mean time have a play and know that the settings (or \"Management Console\") is available by pressing ALT+M (if it doesn't react make sure OptiKey is the focussed window - click on it to give it focus).\r\n\r\n### Can I ask a question / request a feature / point out a bug or problem / ask a question?\r\nPlease do. I can be contacted here: optikeyfeedback@gmail.com\r\n\r\n### Where is the source code?\r\nIf you want to take a look at the source code, or contribute, the source is available here: https://github.com/JuliusSweetland/OptiKey\r\n\r\n### Can I help with this project?\r\nAbsolutely. This is an open source project and I would love to build a community of volunteers around OptiKey. Email me: optikeyfeedback@gmail.com\r\nI have a list the length of my arm of ideas, features and improvements. Here's a sample;\r\n* Add support for more languages (dictionaries, as well as localising OptiKey)\r\n* Improve the algorithms which matches multi-key selections to dictionary words\r\n* Add word completion / incorrect spelling suggestions\r\n* Add next word suggestions\r\n* Support for accessible buttons, sip/puff tubes, brain potential detection, and lots of other human interfaces\r\n* and lots more...\r\n\r\n### Can I borrow some of your source code for a project I'm working on?\r\nYes of course, but my code is licensed under the  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (Version 3, 29 June 2007). A copy of this license accompanies each install, as well as the source code (in the \"Solution Items\" folder). My take on this is; go ahead by all means, build on top of whatever you want, but your project must also be open source and licensed under GNU GPL v3. Maybe you'd like to contribute to OptiKey directly instead? If so get in touch: optikeyfeedback@gmail.com\r\n\r\nThanks for your interest and I hope you find OptiKey useful.\r\n\r\nJulius","google":"UA-58685742-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
