* Why I disabled the Visual Studio Hosting Process (VSHostingProcess):
Debugging the applicatino with a host process seems to prevent the <supportedOS> settings in my app.manifest from being detected.
This leads to incorrect OS Version information when calling Environment.OSVersion.Version (Windows 8.1 and beyond are reported as v6.2 == Windows 8).

* Why I attempted to re-write the InputSimulator:
I was an idiot and was using the Ctrl key as my trigger button. This was, predictably, resulting in published keystrokes having a Ctrl modifier.
