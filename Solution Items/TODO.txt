Make some notes before RHN meeting;
	What I want to achieve:
		For this to rival and become a viable alternative to commercial/paid for products.
		Build a community to support it.
		Be able to suggest accompanying hardware (tablet/laptop + eye tracker) for a low cost DIY solution.
	What I think the next steps are:
		Trial & improve.
	How I imagine they could help:
		Offer advice.
		Trial the software and provide feedback.
		Have patients trial the software and provide feedback.
		Regular SDLC involving them trialing each release candidate. Possible joint future?
	Initial questions:
		Does it work?
		Glaring problems/issues?
		What support will I need to offer?
		Obvious next steps?

TEST UIACCESS:
	Unable to debug with UiAccess true. It also asks for administrator privileges, so maybe it was only working from Program Files as my user (Julius) is special?
	UiAccess=true does NOT work if Start Without Debugger is attemped.

	Do I need admin privileges? NO "asInvoker" works fine, BUT UIACCESS & SECURE LOCATION APPEAR TO BE REQUIRED. 
	Setting requireAdministrator only requires confirmation before starting. It does NOT allow an insecure location to work.
	Click2Speak runs from C:\Users\Julius\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0\51EBCVV8.OV4\4363V1M5.AQ1 and DOES require elevated privileges at startup.

	This article suggests no admin needed: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/cjacks/archive/2009/10/15/using-the-uiaccess-attribute-of-requestedexecutionlevel-to-improve-applications-providing-remote-control-of-the-desktop.aspx
		If not then modifying the app manifest to request uiAccess could be done in the pre-publish stage, before signing occurs?
	This article suggests that uiaccess DOES need admin privilege AND for the app to be installed in Program Files (or other trusted directory). HOW DOES CLICK2SPEAK DO IT? http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee671610(v=vs.85).aspx
		To use UIAccess, an assistive technology application needs to:
			1.Be signed with a certificate to interact with applications running at a higher privilege level.
			2a.Be trusted by the system and run with administrative privileges.
			2b.The application must be installed in a secure location that requires a user account control (UAC) prompt to write to (for example, the Program Files folder).
			3.Be built with a manifest file that includes the UIAccess flag.
			
UIACCESS: Can I change the manifest post-build? DOESN'T APPEAR LIKE I CAN - I THINK THE MANIFEST IS BUILT INTO THE EXE. LOOK INTO PRE-PUBLISH, OR RELEASE BUILD MANIFEST CHANGES
	If yes, then set up a pre-publish event to change the manifest: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3887050/can-visual-studio-post-build-events-be-used-with-clickonce-publishing

SIGN ASSEMBLY:
	Download my cert here (store in solution folder, but EXCLUDE FROM GITHUB): https://cservices.certum.pl/muc-customer/customerCertificate/list
	Set up a post build event to sign the assembly

		Certmgr.msc

Publish as ClickOnce
	http://elbruno.com/2013/06/01/azure-howto-publish-a-clickonce-application-using-and-azure-website/
	Investigate certificate signing the application and deployment manifests for uiAccess
	Investigate strong naming the application and deployment manifests as a requirement of ClickOnce deployment

Profile and optimise, especially keyboard transitions

Refactor any remaining large classes, e.g. MainViewModel
	Create new 'InputBroker'/'InputHandler'/'InputRouter' class which takes the view model, input service, outputservice, etc and coordinates the response

Buy OptiKey.com

Create gmail account for OptiKey

Create skeleton website (on Azure?)

Add details on how to provide feedback in README.md file
	How to turn on debugging mode and find logs to include in email

Sort out sizing/layout of suggestions
	Phrases should wrap
	Individually size? OR Size consistently, but wrap letters (breaking words) so as large as possible

Preview settings in management console

!Release down keys logic seems to release keys which aren't down, e.g. F4 on shutdown!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO DO?
Add support for USB (hardware) buttons (to act as triggers)?
Store usage statistics in a case sensitive way? Would need to keep track of originally cased entries (incl. suggestions). Does this have any benefit? Think about whole advantage of storing usage statistics. 
Character codes â€“ ALT on/lock, then numbers, then ALT off
Auto complete words
	+ auto correct words
Predict next word
Add high contrast theme
Test this product: http://www.cameramouse.org/
Get and test the Tobii EyeX: http://www.tobii.com/en/eye-experience/#.UwMlifl5OkF
No position input possible - automatically cycle through groups of keys, then keys in group: 
	Keyboards could define ordered set of KeyValues; the key "groups"
	New SelectionMode = KeyGroups - this then changes to PositionSource to a source which automatically loops through the current keyboard's groups.
	Position source can output more than one current point: CurrentKey would become a set (allowing the highlighting of a group of keys)
	Selection (of a set of KeyValues) when SelectionMode = KeyGroups does not produce a SelectionResult, but instead disables all keys not in the group (not explicitly, but instead based on a property, e.g. CurrentKeyGroup). SelectionMode then changes to Key.
	In Key mode the position source could iterate through all enabled keys in the key map (which should be the selected group of keys).
		Selection => normal key selection and reset mode back to KeyGroups.
		? If no selection in X iterations through the keys then output a special selection, e.g. a null selection (the trigger can watch the position source, like the fixation triggers.
	Each key group should contain a 'back' key to return from group selection?
Add support for T9 style selection; either individual keys, or multi key select?
Consider releasing a version which does not require admin privileges
