TEST UIACCESS: Do I need admin privileges? NO "asInvoker" works fine, BUT UIACCESS & SECURE LOCATION APPEAR TO BE REQUIRED. 
	Setting requireAdministrator only requires confirmation before starting. It does NOT allow an insecure location to work.
	Click2Speak runs from C:\Users\Julius\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0\51EBCVV8.OV4\4363V1M5.AQ1 and DOES require elevated privileges at startup.

	This article suggests no admin needed: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/cjacks/archive/2009/10/15/using-the-uiaccess-attribute-of-requestedexecutionlevel-to-improve-applications-providing-remote-control-of-the-desktop.aspx
		If not then modifying the app manifest to request uiAccess could be done in the pre-publish stage, before signing occurs?
	This article suggests that uiaccess DOES need admin privilege AND for the app to be installed in Program Files (or other trusted directory). HOW DOES CLICK2SPEAK DO IT? http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee671610(v=vs.85).aspx
		To use UIAccess, an assistive technology application needs to:
			1.Be signed with a certificate to interact with applications running at a higher privilege level.
			2a.Be trusted by the system and run with administrative privileges.
			2b.The application must be installed in a secure location that requires a user account control (UAC) prompt to write to (for example, the Program Files folder).
			3.Be built with a manifest file that includes the UIAccess flag.
			
UIACCESS: Can I change the manifest post-build? DOESN'T APPEAR LIKE I CAN - I THINK THE MANIFEST IS BUILT INTO THE EXE. LOOK INTO PRE-PUBLISH, OR RELEASE BUILD MANIFEST CHANGES
	If yes, then set up a pre-publish event to change the manifest: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3887050/can-visual-studio-post-build-events-be-used-with-clickonce-publishing

READ UP ABOUT THE MANIFEST NOT BEING DETECTED/USED WHEN DEBUGGER IS ATTACHED
	IT WORKS IF I TURN OFF THE VISUAL STUDIO HOSTING PROCESS UNDER BUILD OPTIONS - WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS?
	i.e. if I run ETTA standalone I get the correct OS Version (my manifest is being detected), but if I run with the debugger attached (a vshost wrapper) I get the wrong version, as if my manifest is not being used.

Get a certificate (1), sign the release build (2) and package ETTA to install to Program Files directory (3) - required to be get UI Access and stay on top of Metro

Refactor any remaining large classes, e.g. MainViewModel
	Create new 'InputBroker'/'InputHandler'/'InputRouter' class which takes the view model, input service, outputservice, etc and coordinates the response

Sort out sizing/layout of suggestions
	Phrases should wrap
	Individually size? OR Size consistently, but wrap letters (breaking words) so as large as possible

!Release down keys logic seems to release keys which aren't down, e.g. F4 on shutdown!

TO DO?
Add support for USB (hardware) buttons (to act as triggers)?
Store usage statistics in a case sensitive way? Would need to keep track of originally cased entries (incl. suggestions). Does this have any benefit? Think about whole advantage of storing usage statistics. 
Character codes â€“ ALT on/lock, then numbers, then ALT off
Auto complete words
	+ auto correct words
Predict next word

No position input possible - automatically cycle through groups of keys, then keys in group: 
	Keyboards could define ordered set of KeyValues; the key "groups"
	New SelectionMode = KeyGroups - this then changes to PositionSource to a source which automatically loops through the current keyboard's groups.
	Position source can output more than one current point: CurrentKey would become a set (allowing the highlighting of a group of keys)
	Selection (of a set of KeyValues) when SelectionMode = KeyGroups does not produce a SelectionResult, but instead disables all keys not in the group (not explicitly, but instead based on a property, e.g. CurrentKeyGroup). SelectionMode then changes to Key.
	In Key mode the position source could iterate through all enabled keys in the key map (which should be the selected group of keys).
		Selection => normal key selection and reset mode back to KeyGroups.
		? If no selection in X iterations through the keys then output a special selection, e.g. a null selection (the trigger can watch the position source, like the fixation triggers.
	Each key group should contain a 'back' key to return from group selection?
	
Add support for T9 style selection; either individual keys, or multi key select?

Why is windows 8.1 reporting itself as 6.2 (Windows 8) rather than 6.3.
	Ok when exe run directly, but not when run using visual studio debugging.
