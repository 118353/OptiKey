Sort out look of manipulate window keyboard icons (arrows rendered to different sizes).
	Replace diagonal arrows
	OR Make all arrows fill a bounding box, i.e. make long (not diagonal) arrows stumpier/cut off their tail so they are square.

TEST Window is TopMost after spawning child window
	1.Toast notification
	2.Management window
	If not try this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1705109/how-to-stop-wpf-topmost-flag-on-parent-window-from-being-inherited-by-the-child

TEST Window styling from theme
	It's because each window is not of type Window, but instead derives from Window. Styles are not applied to derived types.

TEST the 8 vs 8.1 version problem
	Is it resolved by;
	1.Running as admin?
	2.Running when not attached to Visual Studio?
	3.Running with uiAccess?

TEST Do I actually need admin privileges? I only added this for uiAccess, but I don't think this is a requirement.
	If not then modifying the app manifest to request uiAccess could be done in the pre-publish stage, before signing occurs?
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms742884(v=vs.110).aspx
	This article suggests that uiaccess DOES need admin privilege AND for the app to be installed in Program Files (or other trusted directory). HOW DOES CLICK2SPEAK DO IT?

Get a certificate (1), sign the release build (2) and package ETTA to install to Program Files directory (3) - required to be get UI Access and stay on top of Metro
	Free (1 year trial?) certificate for Open Source projects; https://www.certum.eu/certum/cert,offer_en_open_source_cs.xml

Publish as ClickOnce
	http://elbruno.com/2013/06/01/azure-howto-publish-a-clickonce-application-using-and-azure-website/
	Investigate certificate signing the application and deployment manifests for uiAccess
	Investigate strong naming the application and deployment manifests as a requirement of ClickOnce deployment

Think about how to pause/prevent the point source during multi-key selection processing.
	Disabling all points prevents the Multi-key selection trigger storyboard from playing as the disabled datatrigger is taking precedence.
		CAN I MAKE THE ANIMATION TAKE CORRECT PRECEDENCE?

Pause point source when switching keyboards - on unload/load of content of Keyboard host, i.e. when KeyboardHost.Content changes
	Need to make sure KeyValueMap is nulled out when a keyboard changes, and only gets set again when the view is rendered fully?
	Do some testing around when the newContent.Loaded event fires, compared to when the Content is set, and the ContentRendered event fires. I think Loaded on the content is best, but still test.

	In GenerateContent - set PointToKeyValueMap = null; before changing the content.
	Optimise RebuildPointToKeyMap:
		a)If Content == null then PointToKeyValueMap = null
		b)Find Keys from Content, not from top layer. There won't be any and this is extra work.

Profile and optimise, especially keyboard transitions

Refactor any remaining large classes, e.g. MainViewModel
	Create new 'InputBroker'/'InputHandler'/'InputRouter' class which takes the view model, input service, outputservice, etc and coordinates the response

Sort out sizing/layout of suggestions
	Phrases should wrap
	Individually size? OR Size consistently, but wrap letters (breaking words) so as large as possible

Preview settings in management console

!Release down keys logic seems to release keys which aren't down, e.g. F4 on shutdown!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO DO?
Add support for USB (hardware) buttons (to act as triggers)?
Store usage statistics in a case sensitive way? Would need to keep track of originally cased entries (incl. suggestions). Does this have any benefit? Think about whole advantage of storing usage statistics. 
Character codes â€“ ALT on/lock, then numbers, then ALT off
Auto complete words
	+ auto correct words
Predict next word
Add high contrast theme

No position input possible - automatically cycle through groups of keys, then keys in group: 
	Keyboards could define ordered set of KeyValues; the key "groups"
	New SelectionMode = KeyGroups - this then changes to PositionSource to a source which automatically loops through the current keyboard's groups.
	Position source can output more than one current point: CurrentKey would become a set (allowing the highlighting of a group of keys)
	Selection (of a set of KeyValues) when SelectionMode = KeyGroups does not produce a SelectionResult, but instead disables all keys not in the group (not explicitly, but instead based on a property, e.g. CurrentKeyGroup). SelectionMode then changes to Key.
	In Key mode the position source could iterate through all enabled keys in the key map (which should be the selected group of keys).
		Selection => normal key selection and reset mode back to KeyGroups.
		? If no selection in X iterations through the keys then output a special selection, e.g. a null selection (the trigger can watch the position source, like the fixation triggers.
	Each key group should contain a 'back' key to return from group selection?
	
Add support for T9 style selection; either individual keys, or multi key select?

Why is windows 8.1 reporting itself as 6.2 (Windows 8) rather than 6.3.
	Ok when exe run directly, but not when run using visual studio debugging.
