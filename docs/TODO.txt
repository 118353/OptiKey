Mouse control
	Correct mouse icons - slight overlap on lines at the moment
	Add keyboard for mouse clicks:
		Left
		Right
		Double (Left)
		Drag (Left down @ pos1, up @ pos2)
		Scroll horizontal/vertical by x units = 5 buttons (left, up, right, down, qty)
	Select a key -> 
		Change mode to position source = point
		Display cursor at point source position
		Change cursor to something customisable - is this even required? This is possible within windows.
			Size/shape from settings?
			Colour from theme?
			Set of cursor images the user can select?
		Dwell in an area to register interest at this point
			Take the action at this point (click, scroll etc)
			Test and improve this to make sure it is consistent before moving on
		Add magnification functionality (setting to turn on/off, for each possible click event, e.g. on for left/right clicks, off for free scrolling)
			Display magnification of area in center of screen - screenshot or live view?
				http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11994331/magnify-a-specific-area-of-the-screen
				
			Options:
				Register interest again to complete action
				Zoom in / zoom out (if zoomed in more than 1 level already)
				Back (discard mouse action and return to keyboard)

Profile and optimise, especially keyboard transitions

Refactor any remaining large classes, e.g. MainViewModel
	Create new 'InputBroker'/'InputHandler'/'InputRouter' class which takes the view model, input service, outputservice, etc and coordinates the response

Sort out sizing/layout of suggestions
	Phrases should wrap
	Individually size? OR Size consistently, but wrap letters (breaking words) so as large as possible

Clarify settings
	Rename point source settings to mouse click or something similar
	Preview images/render of settings?
	Add help prompts in management console

Make toast notifications themable

!Release down keys logic seems to release keys which aren't down, e.g. F4 on shutdown why?!

FUTURE PLANS:
Mouse control
Add support for USB (hardware) buttons (to act as triggers)?
Automatic error reporting - SmartAssembly is one option?
Store usage statistics in a case sensitive way? Would need to keep track of originally cased entries (incl. suggestions). Does this have any benefit? Think about whole advantage of storing usage statistics. 
Character codes â€“ ALT on/lock, then numbers, then ALT off
Auto complete words
	+ auto correct words
Predict next word
Add high contrast theme
Get and test the Tobii EyeX: http://www.tobii.com/en/eye-experience/#.UwMlifl5OkF
No position input possible - automatically cycle through groups of keys, then keys in group: 
	Keyboards could define ordered set of KeyValues; the key "groups"
	New SelectionMode = KeyGroups - this then changes to PositionSource to a source which automatically loops through the current keyboard's groups.
	Position source can output more than one current point: CurrentKey would become a set (allowing the highlighting of a group of keys)
	Selection (of a set of KeyValues) when SelectionMode = KeyGroups does not produce a SelectionResult, but instead disables all keys not in the group (not explicitly, but instead based on a property, e.g. CurrentKeyGroup). SelectionMode then changes to Key.
	In Key mode the position source could iterate through all enabled keys in the key map (which should be the selected group of keys).
		Selection => normal key selection and reset mode back to KeyGroups.
		? If no selection in X iterations through the keys then output a special selection, e.g. a null selection (the trigger can watch the position source, like the fixation triggers.
	Each key group should contain a 'back' key to return from group selection?
	Need a setting to determine whether a key group should be used directly (for T9 style matching), or only to reduce the key map (which will be iterated through to make the next selection).
	Key groups can have sub groups to allow the selection of a row, then a group of keys on that row, then a key (for example)
BCI - eg "Communication by BCI based on EEG": http://youtu.be/k98_1jSnEv4

Add support for T9 style selection; either individual keys, or multi key select?
Prevent minimising, or at least ask before allowing it?
Continuous integration - octokit uses QED: https://github.com/half-ogre/qed/

POSSIBLE THINGS:
BUG FIX: v1.0.5 installer still untrusted on Lee's Microsoft Signature tablet. Why? Not enough repuation? (SmartScreen filter)
BUG FIX: Installer listed .Net framework 4.5.2 as a requirement of installation, but ran through it too quickly.
