Why I cannot install Certum certificate on Windows 8, but fine on Windows 7. Home edition vs something else?

Signing:
	Get certificate working
	Sign assembly as part of buld (VS project config)
	Sign assembly when building? Otherwise when deploying.
	Sign installer when deploying (Inno setup: http://www.codenewsfast.com/cnf/article/0/waArticleBookmark.7282453 / http://revolution.screenstepslive.com/s/revolution/m/10695/l/95041-signing-installers-you-create-with-inno-setup)

TEST Add minimum windows version to Inno setup (>= 6.0.6002):
	Windows Vista, Service Pack 2: 6.0.6002
	Windows Server 2008 SP2: 6.0.6002
	Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1: 6.1.7601

Add dependency on latest .Net Framework 4.5 to Inno setup:

Splash screen on first run - tell user about Alt+M

Automatic updates:
	Manually check latest GitHub release version
		Display notification if update available - they can update manually
		Add setting to disable checks

	Do I need a proper website to support this? If so then look at Azure again.

Profile and optimise, especially keyboard transitions

Refactor any remaining large classes, e.g. MainViewModel
	Create new 'InputBroker'/'InputHandler'/'InputRouter' class which takes the view model, input service, outputservice, etc and coordinates the response

Sort out sizing/layout of suggestions
	Phrases should wrap
	Individually size? OR Size consistently, but wrap letters (breaking words) so as large as possible

Preview settings in management console

!Release down keys logic seems to release keys which aren't down, e.g. F4 on shutdown!

POSSIBLE THINGS TO DO:
Add support for USB (hardware) buttons (to act as triggers)?
Store usage statistics in a case sensitive way? Would need to keep track of originally cased entries (incl. suggestions). Does this have any benefit? Think about whole advantage of storing usage statistics. 
Character codes â€“ ALT on/lock, then numbers, then ALT off
Auto complete words
	+ auto correct words
Predict next word
Add high contrast theme
Get and test the Tobii EyeX: http://www.tobii.com/en/eye-experience/#.UwMlifl5OkF
No position input possible - automatically cycle through groups of keys, then keys in group: 
	Keyboards could define ordered set of KeyValues; the key "groups"
	New SelectionMode = KeyGroups - this then changes to PositionSource to a source which automatically loops through the current keyboard's groups.
	Position source can output more than one current point: CurrentKey would become a set (allowing the highlighting of a group of keys)
	Selection (of a set of KeyValues) when SelectionMode = KeyGroups does not produce a SelectionResult, but instead disables all keys not in the group (not explicitly, but instead based on a property, e.g. CurrentKeyGroup). SelectionMode then changes to Key.
	In Key mode the position source could iterate through all enabled keys in the key map (which should be the selected group of keys).
		Selection => normal key selection and reset mode back to KeyGroups.
		? If no selection in X iterations through the keys then output a special selection, e.g. a null selection (the trigger can watch the position source, like the fixation triggers.
	Each key group should contain a 'back' key to return from group selection?
Add support for T9 style selection; either individual keys, or multi key select?
Prevent minimising, or at least ask before allowing it?
