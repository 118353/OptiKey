Requirements to work:
	1.Elevated privileges - Click2Speak does NOT need elevated privileges. My tests also suggest that this is not required.
	2.Signed assembly (by a trusted certificate) - use the Signing tab on project properties to sign manifests (deployment and application manifests) AND assembly
	3."Secure location" - Click2Speak appears to install a shill in the ClickOnce location and the rest of the files in Program Files
	4.UiAccess="True" flag - this prevents debugging so set in Release mode Post-Build/Pre-Publish* only
